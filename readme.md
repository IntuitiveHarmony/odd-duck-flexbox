# Odd Duck Flexbox

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Complete each step by using flexbox properties.  Edit only the `style.css` file

Step 1: Get your ducks in a (horizontal) row

Step 2: This makes a duck fall off!  Get all the ducks to stay on the island 

Step 3: With only flex, are you able to make all the ducks stand at the same height?

Step 4: Put some space between the flex items using something other than margin or padding

Step 5: ADD a flex property that will stack the ducks vertically again

At this point you should have a stack of ducks on the right side of the island
Step 6: Are you able to put the vertical stack of ducks in the center of the island?

Step 7: Leaving the rest of the ducks in place, put the odd duck in the first position

Step 8: Put the rest of the ducks in descending order (5, 4 , 3, 2, 1)

tep 9: Zig-zag the the ducks within the .container
